    <h1>Report</h1>
    <p>My project1 to my knowledge met the requirements listed. My static website was built without any external
        libraries like REACT or bootstrap and is organized into meaningful subdivisions with a total of five unique
        pages. My classes, and variables, are all named things that should hopefully make sense in context. My files are
        organized into directories like the directions indicated. Also, in terms of styling, I used two different fonts
        and included a fade in animation for the bodies of each page. </p>
