                <h1 class="section-header">What is plant based meat made from?</h1>
                <p class="section-body">Plant based meats are largely made from a mix of peas, soy, mushrooms, beans, or
                    wheat gluten. There are many tricks that are employed to make the plant based products appear to be
                    more
                    like the meat they emulate; they are often dyed red or brown, and plant oils are sometimes added to
                    improve flavor and give the appearance of marbling.<br><br>
                    Seeds, veggies, and nuts are also often added. Yeast is a common ingredient as well since it adds a
                    "meatier" taste and an umami flavor. Vitamins like zinc, B12, and iron are also often added to plant
                    based meats since they are present in real meat as well.
                </p>
                <h1 class="section-header">The challenge of texture</h1>
                <p class="section-body">The texture of real meat is very hard to replicate with vegetarian / vegan
                    ingredients. Plant based meats often come in "crumbles" since the texture difference is harder to
                    notice in smaller pieces. Though it is difficult, companies have taken steps to soften up plant
                    based alternatives and make them feel more like real meat.<br><br>
                    Oils from canola, coconut, and shea are added as a fat source to bind the product together and make
                    them juicier. This is often compounded with pea protein which makes the product more firm and
                    fibrous. The last step is usually carrot fibre, and synthetic plant derived thickening agents.</p>
