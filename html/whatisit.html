                    <p class="section-body">Plant based meats are largely made from a mix of peas, soy, mushrooms, beans, or
                        wheat gluten. There are many tricks that are employed to make the plant based products appear to be
                        more
                        like the meat they emulate; they are often dyed red or brown, and plant oils are sometimes added to
                        improve flavor and give the appearance of marbling.<br><br>
                        Seeds, veggies, and nuts are also often added. Yeast is a common ingredient as well since it adds a
                        "meatier" taste and an umami flavor. Vitamins like zinc, B12, and iron are also often added to plant
                        based meats since they are present in real meat as well.
                    </p>
                    <h1 class="section-header">The challenge of texture</h1>
                    <p class="section-body">The texture of real meat is very hard to replicate with vegetarian / vegan
                        ingredients. Plant based meats often come in "crumbles" since the texture difference is harder to
                        notice in smaller pieces. Though it is difficult, companies have taken steps to soften up plant
                        based alternatives and make them feel more like real meat.<br><br>
                        Oils from canola, coconut, and shea are added as a fat source to bind the product together and make
                        them juicier. This is often compounded with pea protein which makes the product more firm and
                        fibrous. The last step is usually carrot fibre, and synthetic plant derived thickening agents.</p>
