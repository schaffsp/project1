                    Currently, plant based meat alternatives are generally more expensive than their real meat
                    counterparts. There are a number of reasons, however, for its premium price.
                    <br><br>
                    Since not many companies have the capacity to produce plant based meats, there is no reason for them
                    to sell at the lowest possible price. Also, the biggest producers still cannot meet the demand for
                    plant based meats so they are not going to charge less than consumers are willing to pay. If they
                    lowered prices all they would be doing is lowering their revenue since they would not be able to
                    sell any more products.
                    <br><br>
                    The next issue is supply. The plant based meat industry is only about 1% the size of the domestic
                    meat market, and about a tenth of a percent of the global meat market. As the industry grows, access
                    to the raw materials required to make plant based meats will be cheaper and hopefully drive the
                    price down. Currently, many of the main ingredients in the most popular plant based meats are
                    basically just side products that come about as a part of the production of other products.
                </p>
                <h1 class="section-header">A cheaper future</h1>
                <p class="section-body">
                    Despite its current high price, plant based meats are expected to become cheaper in the coming
                    years. Since plant based meats are a relatively new product, the cost of research and development
                    are still being paid off by the consumer. Also, the longer each producer spends making plant based
                    meats, the more streamlined and cheaper the process will become.
                    <br><br>
                    Vegetarianism, and to a lesser degree veganism, is a growing dietary trend. More and more people are
                    choosing not to eat meat every year. Once the market grows enough, companies will have the ability
                    to leverage economies of scale, and be able to produce much higher quantities of plant based meats
                    driving the price down.
